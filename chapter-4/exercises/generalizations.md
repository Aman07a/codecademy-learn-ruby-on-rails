### ASSOCIATIONS II

## Generalizations

**<1 min**

Congratulations! <br>
You built a movie website that lets people browse a movie’s cast and an actor’s filmography. <br>
What can we generalize so far?

- Actors and movies can be modeled using a many-to-many relationship. <br>
  In Rails, this can be implemented using a `has_many :through` association.
- The `has_many :through` association joins two models via a third model.
