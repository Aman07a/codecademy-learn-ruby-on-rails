## Adding More Data

**1 min**

As we build more complex apps, we have to consider multiple models. <br>
For instance, what if we want to build an app with more than one kind of data, like Team and Athlete? <br>
Both Team and Athlete should have different columns and it would get messy to represent both in one model. <br>
Instead, we can represent them using two models.

Let’s see how we can use multiple models in a Rails app that helps users travel.

## Instructions

We’ve taken the steps to create a Rails app called **TravelApp** along with the installation of the necessary gems to get us started.

Go ahead and take a look through the files and folders before we build it out!
