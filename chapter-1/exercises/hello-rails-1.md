## Hello Rails I

**3 min**

[Ruby on Rails](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/ruby-on-rails) is a web framework
that makes it easy to build powerful web apps in a short amount of time.

Ruby on Rails is written in the Ruby programming language.
If you are new to Ruby, we recommend you first take [our Ruby course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby).

#### Instructions

1. Let’s get started by making a Rails app for a personal website.
   We’ll explain each step in the next exercise.

   In the terminal, type:

   ```bash
   rails new MySite
   ```

2. Next, navigate to the MySite directory using:

   ```bash
   cd MySite
   ```

3. Now to install all of the dependencies, use:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

4. Finally, to boot up the server, type:

   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

   Then, view the Rails app by visiting or refreshing http://localhost:4001 in the provided browser.

   You should see the Ruby on Rails logo!
